# Product Context: Puppeteer Scraper API

## Why This Project Exists

This project addresses the need to transform standalone Puppeteer scraping scripts into a robust, accessible API service. The client requires a system that can automate various web scraping tasks and expose them as API endpoints, allowing them to integrate web scraping capabilities into their broader applications.

## Problems It Solves

1. **Integration Complexity**: Transforms isolated scraping scripts into API endpoints that can be called from any service
2. **Resource Management**: Centralizes browser automation to efficiently manage resources
3. **Bot Detection Avoidance**: Uses Browserbase to handle proxies, CAPTCHAs, and bot detection mechanisms
4. **Deployment Challenges**: Solves issues related to running Puppeteer in production environments
5. **Maintenance Overhead**: Creates a standardized framework for adding and updating scraping scripts
6. **Concurrency Limitations**: Manages the constraint of 3 concurrent browser sessions with Browserbase

## How It Should Work

1. **API-First Architecture**:

   - RESTful API endpoints that correspond to specific scraping tasks
   - Each endpoint accepts parameters via POST request bodies
   - Authentication via simple API key mechanism
   - JSON responses with structured scraped data

2. **Request Flow**:

   ```
   Client Request → Authentication → Parameter Validation →
   Puppeteer Script Execution → Data Extraction → Response Formatting → Client Response
   ```

3. **Containerized Deployment**:

   - Docker container for consistent environment
   - CI/CD pipeline for automatic updates when script code changes

4. **Configuration Management**:
   - Environment variables for configuration settings
   - API keys stored securely (file-based for MVP)
   - Logging of operations for debugging and monitoring

## User Experience Goals

1. **Developer-Friendly**:

   - Clear API documentation
   - Consistent response formats
   - Meaningful error messages

2. **Operational Reliability**:

   - Handle edge cases gracefully
   - Provide appropriate timeout and retry mechanisms
   - Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse

3. **Performance**:

   - Optimize scraping operations for speed
   - Efficiently manage browser resources
   - Scale according to demand within resource constraints

4. **Security**:

   - Protect API with authentication
   - Securely handle credentials and sensitive data
   - Sanitize inputs to prevent injection attacks

5. **Extensibility**:
   - Make it easy to add new scraping endpoints
   - Allow configuration of existing endpoints without code changes where possible

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

1. **Data Persistence**:

   - Add PostgreSQL database for storing API keys and user information
   - Implement caching of scraping results to reduce redundant operations
   - Store usage metrics and analytics

2. **Advanced Management**:
   - User management interface
   - Dashboard for monitoring usage and performance
   - Detailed logging and analytics
