# Active Context: Puppeteer Scraper API

## Current Work Focus

We are in the implementation phase of the Puppeteer Scraper API project. The focus is on:

1. Fine-tuning the crypto endpoint functionality
2. ✅ Setting up Browserbase integration (completed)
3. Ensuring the API is ready for both development and production use
4. ✅ Transitioning from mock browser to real browser services (completed)
5. Adding the text extraction endpoint

## Recent Changes

- Implemented the MVP with Express server and API routes
- Created Docker configuration for both development and production
- Implemented the `/crypto` endpoint with custom electricity cost parameter
- Added mock browser functionality for development without Browserbase API key
- Created documentation endpoint at the root URL
- Added error handling, logging, and middleware for authentication
- Updated the fallback value for `electricityCost` parameter to make it more explicit
- Integrated the official Browserbase SDK for improved browser automation
- Updated configuration to include both Browserbase API key and Project ID
- Completely refactored the browser service to use the latest Browserbase SDK format
- Successfully tested the `/crypto` endpoint with the real Browserbase integration
- Added additional logging throughout the codebase for better diagnostics
- Created docker-compose.dev.yml and Dockerfile.dev for improved local development

## Active Decisions and Considerations

1. **Technology Stack**:

   - Node.js with Express for the backend
   - Puppeteer-core with Browserbase for web scraping
   - Docker for containerization
   - Environment variable-based API key authentication

2. **Architecture Decisions**:

   - Single Docker service for the backend
   - RESTful API design for scraper endpoints
   - Mock browser pattern for development
   - Middleware pattern for request handling and authentication
   - Fallback mechanism to mock browser when Browserbase is unavailable

3. **Open Questions**:
   - How to optimize Browserbase usage for production with the 3 concurrent session limit
   - Best approach for error handling for scraping failures
   - Future endpoints beyond the crypto endpoint

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Tasks**:

   - ✅ Set up Browserbase account and integrate API key (completed)
   - ✅ Test the crypto endpoint with real browser integration (completed)
   - Add the text extraction endpoint
   - Enhance error handling for production

2. **Short-term Tasks**:

   - Add comprehensive logging
   - Implement rate limiting strategies
   - Add metrics collection
   - Create more detailed API documentation

3. **Medium-term Tasks**:

   - Add more scraping endpoints
   - Implement caching for frequent requests
   - Add monitoring and alerting

4. **Future Considerations**:
   - Persistent storage for scraped data
   - Advanced request queuing
   - Horizontal scaling options
   - User management system
