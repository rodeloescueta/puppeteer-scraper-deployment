# Active Context: Puppeteer Scraper API

## Current Work Focus

We are in the initial planning phase of the Puppeteer Scraper API project. The focus is on:

1. Establishing the project structure and documentation
2. Planning the technical architecture and key components
3. Setting up the development environment
4. Defining the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) requirements

## Recent Changes

- Created initial project documentation in memory-bank
- Defined core requirements and architecture based on client specifications
- Selected technologies for the full-stack JavaScript implementation
- Planned Docker containerization approach with a single backend service
- Removed PostgreSQL database from MVP after reviewing TASK.md requirements

## Active Decisions and Considerations

1. **Technology Stack**:

   - Node.js with Express for the backend
   - Puppeteer-core with Browserbase for web scraping
   - Docker for containerization
   - Simple file-based or environment variable API key authentication

2. **Architecture Decisions**:

   - Single Docker service for the backend (simpler MVP)
   - RESTful API design for scraper endpoints
   - Factory pattern for scraper instantiation
   - Middleware pattern for request handling and authentication

3. **Open Questions**:
   - How to efficiently manage the 3 concurrent browser session limit
   - Best approach for error handling and retries
   - Level of result processing (raw text vs. structured data)
   - Simplest yet secure method for API key management without a database

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Tasks** (MVP Development):

   - Set up project repository with initial structure
   - Create Docker configuration (Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml)
   - Implement basic Express server with health check endpoint
   - Create Browserbase account and test connectivity

2. **Short-term Tasks** (First Endpoints):

   - Implement authentication middleware with API key validation
   - Create the "/crypto" endpoint with the provided script
   - Adapt script to use Browserbase and handle dynamic parameters
   - Implement basic error handling and logging

3. **Medium-term Tasks** (Additional Features):

   - Develop the "/text" endpoint with Readability integration
   - Implement rate limiting and request queuing
   - Add metrics collection and monitoring
   - Create documentation for API usage

4. **Future Considerations** (Post-MVP):
   - Add PostgreSQL database for persistent storage
   - Additional scraper endpoints as needed
   - Advanced caching mechanisms
   - Horizontal scaling options
   - Enhanced monitoring and alerting
