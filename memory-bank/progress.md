# Progress: Puppeteer Scraper API

## Current Status

âœ… **Planning Phase** - Completed  
ðŸŸ¢ **Development Phase** - Active  
ðŸŸ¢ **Testing Phase** - In Progress  
ðŸ”¶ **Deployment Phase** - Partially Started

## What Works

- Project scope and requirements defined
- Technical architecture implemented
- Documentation structure established
- Technology stack implemented
- Express server with API routes
- Docker configuration for both development and production
- CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
- Authentication system with API keys
- `/crypto` endpoint with mock browser mode
- Documentation endpoint at root URL
- Error handling and logging
- Fallback value for electricityCost parameter
- Browserbase SDK integration with Project ID and API key configuration
- Automatic fallback to mock browser when Browserbase is unavailable
- Enhanced development environment with docker-compose.dev.yml and Dockerfile.dev
