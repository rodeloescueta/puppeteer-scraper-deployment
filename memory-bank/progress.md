## Current Status

ðŸŸ¢ **Planning Phase** - Active  
ðŸ”´ **Development Phase** - Not Started  
ðŸ”´ **Testing Phase** - Not Started  
ðŸ”´ **Deployment Phase** - Not Started

## What Works

- Project scope and requirements defined
- Technical architecture planned
- Documentation structure established
- Technology stack selected
- Simplified MVP requirements (removed database dependency)

## What's Left to Build

- [ ] Request validation middleware
- [ ] Error handling framework
- [ ] Logging implementation
- [ ] Rate limiting mechanism

### Scraper Endpoints

- [ ] "/crypto" endpoint

  - [ ] Adapt existing script to use Browserbase
  - [ ] Implement dynamic parameter handling
  - [ ] Parse and format response data

- [ ] "/text" endpoint
  - [ ] Create URL content extractor
  - [ ] Integrate Mozilla Readability
  - [ ] Implement text cleaning and formatting

### Infrastructure & DevOps

- [ ] Development environment setup
- [ ] Testing framework configuration
- [ ] API documentation
- [ ] Deployment pipeline
- [ ] Monitoring setup

## Time Estimates

| Phase                       | Estimated Duration | Dependencies                |
| --------------------------- | ------------------ | --------------------------- |
| Project Setup               | 1 day              | None                        |
| Backend Development         | 3-5 days           | Project Setup               |
| API Endpoint Implementation | 3-4 days           | Backend Development         |
| Testing                     | 2-3 days           | API Endpoint Implementation |
| Documentation               | 1-2 days           | Ongoing                     |
| Deployment                  | 1 day              | Testing                     |

**Total Estimated Time**: 1.5-2.5 weeks (reduced from initial estimate)

## Known Issues

- No active issues yet - project in planning phase

## Next Milestone

**MVP with "/crypto" Endpoint**

- Basic Express server running in Docker
- Authentication system working (file-based)
- "/crypto" endpoint operational with Browserbase integration
- Minimal error handling and logging

**Target Completion**: End of first development week

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

- [ ] Add PostgreSQL database for persistent storage
- [ ] Implement user management system
- [ ] Add caching for frequently requested data
- [ ] Create admin interface
- [ ] Implement advanced analytics and monitoring
